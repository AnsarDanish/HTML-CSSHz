    <p>In-charge of Bharatiya Janata Party's National Information & Technology Dept Amit Malviya on Saturday hit out at the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi over income tax raids at its MP Dhiraj Sahu's premises in Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha. Taking to X, Amit Malviya wrote, “Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra was actually a journey to connect the thieves of India. Congress is #CorruptionKiDukan (the hub of corruption). Nearly ₹300 crore recovered from the premises of Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dheeraj Sahu in Jharkhand is a living proof of this.”</p>
